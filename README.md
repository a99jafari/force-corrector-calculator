# Force Corrector Calculator

This calculator is developed by ReactJS & Typescript. I tried to do the best practices and produce clean codes as much as I can. I think this project will be useful and informative for the junior and mid-level developers and also those who are learning ReactJS + Typescript. If you like, you can cooperate in developing this project and adding new features or refactoring codes.
